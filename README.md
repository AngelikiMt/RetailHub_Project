# RetailHub_Project
RetailHub is a full-stack information system developed as a **capstone group project** for academic purposes. It was designed for *RetailHUB*, a rapidly growing retail business operating both physical and online stores.

This system focuses on a complete restructuring of business operationsâ€”enhancing the management of customers, products, inventory, and sales.

## Project Objectives

- Digitize business data  
- Automate critical processes  
- Enhance data security  
- Support decision-making with modern reports and analytics  
- Reduce operational costs  
- Support both local store operation and centralized business insights  


The project combines:
- a Java-based backend and GUI-Swing UI for CRUD operations and retail logic
- A Python data analysis module for business logic
- A shared MySQL database for persistent data across both layers
