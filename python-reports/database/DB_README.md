# üóÉÔ∏è Database Initialization & Population ‚Äî RetailHub Project

This module (`populate.py`) generates realistic demo data for the RetailHub project's backend database.  
It ensures the schema is fully populated with clean, consistent, and relationally accurate data ‚Äî suitable for testing, analysis, and report generation.

## ‚úÖ What `populate.py` Does

1. **Clients**  
   - Creates `n=100` random clients (with first/last name, gender, birthdate, email, phone)  
   - Randomly sets their `activeStatus`

2. **Stores**  
   - Creates 5 fake store records (with address, country, phone, store name)

3. **Products**  
   - Creates 30 fake products across 3 categories: `'clothing'`, `'electronics'`, `'beauty'`  
   - Each product has price, cost, category, and active status

4. **Stock Entries**  
   - Links each store to ~10 products with random `stockQuantity`  
   - Avoids duplicate (store, product) combinations

5. **Transactions + Includes**  
   - Generates 300 transactions by active clients in random stores  
   - Each transaction has:
     - Timestamp
     - Payment method (`cash`, `card`, `paypal`)
     - 1‚Äì3 products from that store (only if in stock)
     - `includes` rows linking product + quantity sold  
   - Stock is **decremented** accordingly

6. **Client Summary Update**  
   - After all transactions, each client has their:
     - `clientSumTotal` (total amount spent)
     - `lastPurchaseDate` (most recent transaction)  
   - Updated based on actual transaction data

## üí° Notes

- Quantity updates on `stock` are enforced to reflect actual sales  
- All fields follow your final DB schema structure  
- Categories, dates, discounts, and clients are varied for realism
